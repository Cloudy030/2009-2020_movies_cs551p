This is a database driven web application with Flask and published through Render about the movies between year 2009 and 2020.

This project exist as an assignment of the course CS551P and is based on the Movie Industry dataset obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies?resource=download.

Movie table showing all movie data rows will be shown in main page.
By clicking the movie name shown in this page, user will be directed to a movie details page where the details of the movie is shown in the table.
By clicking the rating system page, all ratings used in the data set will be shown in this page with the rating, system definition and explaination s 
By clicking the movie genre page, all movie genres which are applicable in the movie data set is shown with their name and the description of the genre.

Being a database driven web application, the url link https://cs551p-movie.onrender.com shows the result from this repository.

With the limitation of Codio environment, number of rows of data is restricted from 2000 to 7000 rows of data.
In the future, more movies can be added in the database and more rows of data can be added into the database showing movies from different years and add more different types of data points in the movie table structure.
